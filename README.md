# Design Patterns

- **What? :** gn patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code
- **Benefits :** Patterns are a toolkit of solutions to common problems in software design. They define a common language that helps your team communicate more efficiently.
- **Classification :** Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability. In addition, they can be categorized by their intent and divided into three groups

## Classification
1. **Creational patterns :** These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
2. **Structural patterns :** These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
3. **Behavioral patterns :** These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

### Creational patterns
1. **Factory Method :** It is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
